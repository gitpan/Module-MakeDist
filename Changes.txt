Revision history for Perl extension Module::MakeDist.

1.04  Mon Feb 17 10:04:00 2003
	- Patch to stop shipping blib/ directory in Unix distros, because the
		PAUSE indexer takes this directory to indicate a binary distro,
		which means it does not index the module, and this in turn means
		the module is not listed in the CPAN daily update list, etc.
		Procedure:
		o Create Unix-style distro *.tgz
		o Create helper file *.tar.gz. You can ignore this file
		o Create PPM-style distro *.zip, which contains *.tar.gz

1.03  Fri Dec 13 16:21:22 2002
