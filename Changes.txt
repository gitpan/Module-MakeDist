Revision history for Perl extension Module::MakeDist.

1.08  Tue Jul 20 20:43:00 2004
	- Change Makefile.PL to coexist with Module::Build
	- Add t/pod.t to test all PODs

1.07  Mon Feb 23 15:18:23 2004
	- Recent versions of pod2html are leaving files called pod2htmld.tmp and pod2htmli.tmp
		in the working directory. Patch to stop shipping these files
	- Also, recent versions of something are leaving a file called blibdirs in the
		working directory. Patch to stop shipping this file

1.06  Thu Oct 16 09:32:17 2003
	- Change one stray instance of "if ($$self{'_debug'})" to "if ($$self{'_verbose'})".
		'_debug' was left over from an earlier version of the code.
		Now, when you turn on verbose mode, you'll get a tiny bit more output

1.05  Mon Apr 28 21:22:00 2003
	- Ive noticed backticks with redirection of STDERR fail sometimes under WinNT/2K,
		so I've replaced `$Config{'make'} $option 2>&1` with `$Config{'make'} $option`
		rather than require the installation of IPC::Run3

1.04  Mon Feb 17 10:04:00 2003
	- Patch to stop shipping blib/ directory in Unix distros, because the
		PAUSE indexer takes this directory to indicate a binary distro,
		which means it does not index the module, and this in turn means
		the module is not listed in the CPAN daily update list, etc.
		Procedure:
		o Create Unix-style distro *.tgz
		o Create helper file *.tar.gz. You can ignore this file
		o Create PPM-style distro *.zip, which contains *.tar.gz

1.03  Fri Dec 13 16:21:22 2002
	- Patch to match pod2html and pod2text in Perl V 5.8.0
	- Patch ARCHITECTURE line output in *.ppd for ActiveState Perl V 5.8.0

1.02  Sat Oct 26 17:59:00
	- Nmake failed silently building V 1.01 :-(

1.01  Sat Oct 26 14:29:00
	- Minor documentation changes. No need to upgrade

1.00  Sat Sep 28 12:37:29 2002
	- original version
